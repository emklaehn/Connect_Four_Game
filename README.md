This Connect Four Game was created by ZachReeee, eap22, and I as a project for class.

To run this program on your device, download the zip folder and un zip it. Focusing on the "Final Program" folder, go to src/connect/four/.

If you are using an IDE, upload the folder as a project to compile and play the game. If you are using a command prompt to run the game, here is the proper code to use for Unix or Linux systems.

For CLI (Command Line Interface), type the following:

javac *   // enter

java ConnectFourGame.java   // enter

For GUI (Graphical User Interface), type the following:

javac *   // enter

java CommentFourGUI.java    // enter
